1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

A .git file is added that tracks meta data about your directory. This needs to be done in order to 
track changes throughout the history of the directory.




How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

The staging area allows you more precise control over what files are being committed. The working directory is simply 
the current commit that you have checked out, and the repository is your directory with the .git folder.
