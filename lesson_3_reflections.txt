When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

You may be working from an office, but also working from home on the same project as well. 
Using a remote repository allows you to stay in sync across various work environments.





Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

You might make changes to your code locally that isn't ready to be public yet. 
Likewise, changes may have been made to a remote repository that aren't in sync 
with the code that you're working on locally. For these reasons, you might want 
to push and pull changes manually, rather than having Github automatically update.
